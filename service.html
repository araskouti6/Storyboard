<h3>It's a genie taking a girl on an adventure to Athens<br>
  in a building called "The Parthenon" by his<br>
 flying carpet. They both slept there. They woke<br>
  up happily in the morning ready to go on another<br>
 adventure. They both went on the flying carpet <br>
 and went to a chinese tower. The people were <br>
 looking at them strangely because they were <br>
 sitting on top of the tower. They sat <br>
 there the whole night.<br>
