      <h2><em>Storyboards can be especially useful in visual effects and<br>
         action sequences. But they can also be a great tool to<br>
          visualize written scenes or to help overcome productional<br>
           challenges, as J Todd Anderson, who I talked to for this<br>
            article, explains.</em></h2>

<br>
    <h3>The technique of storyboarding was <strong>invented in the Walt Disney Studios</strong><br>
       sometime in the 1930’s.*  It didn’t take long until live action filmmakers also<br>
        began to use storyboards. In 1939, Gone with the Wind was one of the first<br>
         films to be fully storyboarded. As of the 1940’s storyboarding became an<br>
          essential part of the filmmaking process, and it still is today.</h3>

<h3>“Any improvisations are made in the office, while the film is being put on paper. I mean to improvise on <br>the set, with all those electricians and carpenters around? I personally don’t see how it’s done. Imagine <br>a composer with sheets of blank lines in front of him. And a 100 piece orchestra. And he’s thinking and <br>then he calls up, he says: ‘Flute, give me a note, would you?’ And blob, you get the note and he writes it <br>down. Now that’s what improvisation is on the set. I don’t believe in it.”
<br>
<br>
 <br> The above quote comes from a very entertaining and interesting interview session with Alfred Hitchcock, <br>in which he answers questions about what would be his final film, Family Plot. It should not be a <br>surprise that Hitchcock liked working with storyboards. He claimed to see a film in his mind completely <br>and storyboards were a perfect way for him to show the images he saw in his mind to his cast and crew.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>These famous storyboards were drawn by Saul Bass, who is best known for his legendary work as a title <br>and poster designer. During the 1960’s Bass, working as a visual or pictorial consultant, did <br>storyboards for a number of films. There is some controversy surrounding his work on Psycho. After <Br>Hitchcock’s death, Saul Bass claimed that he had also (partially) directed this iconic scene, which was <br>disputed by other people involved in the production.</h3>

      <h2>Alien, storyboards by Ridley Scott (1979)</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="322.jpg"></img>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Like Alfred Hitchcock, whose first film job was designing title cards for silent films, Ridley <br>Scott, has a background as a draftsman. After he graduated from art school he founded a production <br>company together with his brother, Tony, through which they primarily produced commercials.
        <br>
        <br>In advertising, storyboards are used extensively. Not just as a productional tool, but also to <br>convince the client of a creative concept. For inexperienced people it can be difficult to read a <br>script. Sketching it out makes it is easier to communicate an idea. Because this can be a way to <br>increase a commercial’s budget, advertising storyboards are often rendered in much more detail <br>than those made for feature films. Ridley Scott brought this way of storyboarding to the <br>production of Alien –and not without success.
        <br>
        <br> After he agreed to do the film, the studio asked him to wait in England for his contract to come <br>through. When he returned to the studio a month later, Scott had drawn out the entire screenplay <br>in storyboard form. Seeing the way he wanted to visualize the script, convinced the studio to <br>double the budget.
        <br>
        <br> On his recent films Ridley Scott likes to work with professional storyboard artists. They usually <br>start out with the director’s own thumbnail sketches, which are now lovingly known as Ridleygrams. <br>In a DVD extra from Hannibal Scott explains that the process of talking through the script and his <br>sketches with a storyboard artist totally prepares him. So that when he hits the set he knows <br>exactly what he wants to shoot.</h3>

        <h2>Jurassic Park, storyboards by Dave Lowry (1993)</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="09.jpg"></img>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3><br>These storyboards from the iconic final raptor sequence in Jurassic Park, were drawn by Dave <br>Lowry. Lowry is an incredibly experienced artist who has worked on more than 70 feature films. He <br>is a regular collaborator of Steven Spielberg and has worked on all Jurassic Park films, including <br>2015’s Jurassic World.
          <br>
          <br> Steven Spielberg himself doesn’t have a background as a graphic artist, but he still likes to <br>brief storyboard artists with rough sketches of his shots. (As he explains in this video <br>[https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=nBH89Y0Xj7c]) Even when a director is not a skilled draftsman, it <br>is not uncommon for him or her to do sketches that are then turned into storyboards by a sketch <br>artist. It is often very helpful for both the director and the storyboard artist, because it <br>forces the director to think about the best way to visually tell the story. Like Ridley Scott <br>saying that his talks with the storyboard artist are almost a preparation for the actual shoot, <br>these rough thumbnails are a first step towards the final image.
          <br>
          <br>Spielberg used to work with a number of storyboard artists. There were 6 different artists doing <br>storyboards for Jurassic Park. He even liked to have one or two sketch artists available on set, <br>to quickly sketch out ideas that might come up last minute. But is seems that Spielberg is using <br>less storyboards these days. Films like Amistad, Lincoln, Bridge of Spies and even Saving <br>Private Ryan were not storyboarded at all, except for the occasional sequence.
          <br>
          <br> Is this a good thing? Well, Raiders of the Lost Ark was fully storyboarded from beginning to <br>end, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull was not…</h3>

          <h2>Mad Max Fury Road, storyboards by Mark Sexton (2015)</h2>
          <br>
          <img src="55.jpg"></img>
          <br><br><br>
          <h3><br>The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise was a long time in the making. Director <br>George Miller had been working on it going back all the way to 1998. Mark Sexton, who drew these <br>awesome storyboards, worked on the film as a Lead Storyboard Artist between 2000 and 2002. Due <br>to a combination of productional difficulties it would take another 13 years until the film <br>would be released.
            <br>
            <br> Every image in the film was carefully thought out in storyboard form. (The final storyboard <br>existed out of more than 3500 panels) The film notoriously started without a written script <br>and was actually ‘written’ in storyboards, Miller felt that the film had to be put together <br>visually because it is easier to design action that way. This visual way of scripting helped <br>to make Mad Max an iconic piece of visual storytelling.
            <br>
            <br> Many of today’s big action scenes will be shot from several angles using multiple cameras, <br>only to be put together in editing. In Fury Road they used a more classical approach, making <br>sure that there was a strong visual narrative and that the audience could always follow the <br>story without being confused. In a story that features multiple characters chasing each other <br>through a desert in more than 80 vehicles, this is no small feat. By designing all the shots <br>in storyboard form Fury Road turned what could easily have been a chaotic mess into a <br>streamlined action classic that would go on to win 6 Academy Awards and currently holds a 97% <br>score on rotten Tomatoes.
